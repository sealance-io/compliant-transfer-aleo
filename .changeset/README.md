# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that
works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Adding a Changeset

When you make a change to the SDK package (`@sealance-io/policy-engine-aleo`), run:

```bash
npx changeset
```

Follow the prompts to:

1. Select the package being changed (policy-engine-sdk)
2. Choose the semver bump type (patch/minor/major)
3. Write a summary of the changes

This creates a markdown file in this directory that will be consumed when creating a release.

## Release Process

See [RELEASING.md](../docs/RELEASING.md) for the full release workflow documentation.
