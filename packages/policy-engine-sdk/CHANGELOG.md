## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **API Response Parsing**: Improved `fetchWithRetries` in `AleoAPIClient` to properly handle JSON-encoded responses from Aleo API
  - Now correctly parses JSON-quoted strings (e.g., `"value"` â†’ `value`)
  - Handles null responses (`null` string, empty strings)
  - Gracefully falls back to raw text if JSON parsing fails
  - Removes redundant quote-stripping logic from `PolicyEngine`

### Added
- Comprehensive unit tests for API response parsing edge cases
- Tests for JSON-quoted responses, null handling, and empty responses
