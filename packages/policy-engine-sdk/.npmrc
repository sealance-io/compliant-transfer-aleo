# npm Configuration for @sealance-io/policy-engine-aleo SDK
#
# This workspace is published to npm as a public package.
# Settings inherit from root .npmrc but can be overridden here.
#
# IMPORTANT: This file is committed to git because it contains ONLY
# project configuration, NOT secrets. Auth tokens should be stored in:
#   - ~/.npmrc (user-specific)
#   - Environment variables (CI/CD)
#   - Never in project .npmrc files

# ============================================================================
# PUBLISHING SETTINGS
# ============================================================================

# Default registry for publishing (can be overridden by package.json scripts)
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/

# Public package access (redundant with package.json publishConfig but safe)
access=public

# ============================================================================
# SECURITY SETTINGS (inherited from root, repeated for clarity)
# ============================================================================

# Only allow packages from the official npm registry
strict-ssl=true

# Save exact versions for consistency
save-exact=true

# Audit level (inherits from root: moderate for visibility)
# SDK packages should be extra vigilant about dependencies
audit-level=moderate
